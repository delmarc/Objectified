Why???
------

More like why not... I am not a fan of where certain things are going on like with all these strings being processed on the fly by the client for example... I mean, I dont _mind_ but I was like "you know what... since I always say what I say about all this new stuff happening in the JavaScript world, why dont I do anything about it"

Well here it is...


But still why???
----------------

__Well__, there was a project that I had to start where I work now [Line2](http://www.line2.com). Since I didnt want to use anything that already exists because I _partially_ hate them, this is what I did...
